# DIAAA
## Data-Independent Acquisition Analysis App

DIAAA is an offline Shiny app that complements workflows of DIA-NN, EncyclopeDIA, and MSFragger for the generation of high quality, domain-specific results with minimal user intervention. 

DIAAA is organized in a tab architecture with conventional processing group steps in vertical tabs and any appropriate plots segmented into horizontal tab architectures. As part of the simple GUI structure, DIAA allows rapid, logical data analysis steps that are conventionally applied, but may be modified by users with further needs or domain-specific knowledge beyond the generalizations made in the app. 

Instructions for app use are written in the .R file header, but installation of all packages through CRAN, BioConductor and Github should be done using provided code. Once installed, the app can be run by selecting "Run App" in the RStudio environment. If the app opens in a viewer window within RStudio, the pane can be exported to a web browser with appropriate clickbutton adjacent to the viewer window. Setting the viewer window to default to web browser can be done in the dropdown menu conjugated to the "Run App" button. 

After loading the app into a viewer pane, file operations follow logical steps for rapid processing on most personal-grade workstations.

Following the workflow scheme above, inputs are either provided by the user as files or from a list of suggestions provided in the GUI (White bubbles). Input files for DIA-NN and MSFragger are the DIA-NN quant output file report.tsv while EncyclopeDIA inputs should end in "peptides.txt". Outputs are generated in the HTML environment and may be exported as R graphics devices and/or tables. 

To correlate input files with biological features, a .csv design matrix is necessary. A pre-formated matrix can be automatically generated then manually populated with appropriate categorical and numerical information. The modified design matrix can then be re-uploaded for experiemental assignements.

Normalization for EncyclopeDIA data is done on the peptide basis with quantitation done on sum of all measured peptides. In contrast, DIA-NN normalizations are done on the protein matrix following MaxLFQ protein quantitative inference. Batch control (if appropriate) is carried out by HarmonizR using either parametric or non-parametric models of Limma or ComBat as appropriate. After initial normalization and batch correction, exploratory data analysis features are evaluated in a single tab with basic quantitative metrics demonstrated for all samples. 

Imputation is not advised, but modules generated by CPTAC in the DREAM-AI consortium are available for use. 

Dimensional reduction and clustering is achieved through exclusively PCA on complete protein groups and subsequent K-Means cluster inference. Optimal clusters can be determined using a silhouette method. 

Differential expression is carried out by one of multiple available t-testing modules and user-defined significance cutoffs. 

Single protein analysis (e.g., plotting of biological variables with respect to measured intensity of a single protein) is done for numeric and categorical variables with appropriate linear regression inference as well as t-testing and ANOVA significance testing. 

Pathway analysis is generated on the basis of differential expression results, saved as a separate file in the base directory of the report file and are processed through the WebGestaltR implementation of WebGestalt.
