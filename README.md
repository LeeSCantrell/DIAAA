# DIAAA
## Data-Independent Acquisition Analysis App

DIAAA is an offline Shiny app that complements workflows of DIA-NN, EncyclopeDIA, and MSFragger for the generation of high quality, domain-specific results with minimal user intervention. 

DIAAA is organized in a tab architecture with conventional processing group steps in vertical tabs and any appropriate plots segmented into horizontal tab architectures. As part of the simple GUI structure, DIAA allows rapid, logical data analysis steps that are conventionally applied, but may be modified by users with further needs or domain-specific knowledge beyond the generalizations made in the app. 

Instructions for app use are written in the .R file header, but installation of all packages through CRAN, BioConductor and Github should be done using provided code. Once installed, the app can be run by selecting "Run App" in the RStudio environment. If the app opens in a viewer window within RStudio, the pane can be exported to a web browser with appropriate clickbutton adjacent to the viewer window. Setting the viewer window to default to web browser can be done in the dropdown menu conjugated to the "Run App" button. 

After loading the app into a viewer pane, file operations follow logical steps for rapid processing on most personal-grade workstations.
